## Core

### API Token

In the settings of one's own user account, there is a new tab in which an API token can be generated and equipped with the corresponding rights.

Only super administrators or user accounts that belong to a group to which the corresponding right has been assigned have the right to create a token.

This token can then be used with a basic auth to query the previously enabled commands.

### Create process

When creating a task, the mask can be configured via the file `goobi_projects.xml`. Multiselect fields could also be defined with the attribute `multiselect="true"`. If several values were then selected, they ended up one after the other in the configured metadatum or the defined property.

As of this release, a separate metadatum or property is written for each value.

## Plugins

### Step: OCR to metadata

A new step plugin has been developed that allows to convert the OCR text of all images of a process into a metadatum.

## Snippets

* ALTO editing in the metadata editor can now also save files in S3.
* The plugin for automatic PDF extraction has received minor improvements, for example in the case of missing spaces in the full text.
