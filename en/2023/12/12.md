  Developments and news about Goobi workflow

# December 2023

## Core

### Tables

Finally, the column width can be customised within Goobi workflow. The information is saved in the browser's local storage. Once a setting has been made, it is therefore linked to the PC and the browser and is not stored on the server side. This means that different settings can be made on different PCs with different screens so that they do not always get in each other's way.

### GoobiScript

If there are several export steps in a process, you can now pass the title in the GoobiScript so that the correct export is triggered. Example:

```yaml
---
# This GoobiScript allows to export Goobi processes using the default export mechanism. It either uses the default export or alternativly an export plugin that was configured in one of the workflow steps.
action: export

# Decide if the images shall get exported additionally to the metdata (`true`).
exportImages: false

# Decide if the OCR results shall get exported additionally as well (`true`).
exportOcr: false

# Decide which export plugin shall be used by giving the name of this export plugin. It has the highest priority if it is configured. [OPTIONAL]
pluginName: 

# Decide which export plugin shall be used by giving the name of the export step. If it is configured then it will try to find this export step first, and only when there is no such step, will the standard choice be used instead. [OPTIONAL]
stepName: "Export into the Goobi viewer"
```

### Snippets

* Various minor styling adjustments were made in the area of breadcrumbs or menus Initial internal preparations have been made for Java 17 support
* The message queue has received performance improvements
* A discontinued Java library for processing regular expressions that has not been maintained for many years has been removed and replaced by an alternative solution.
