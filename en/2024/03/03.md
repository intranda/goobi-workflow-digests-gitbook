The major changeover in the Maven architecture of Goobi workflow and the plugins is in full swing, which is why there will be no Goobi workflow release in March.

## Core

### Config Editor

The newly integrated configuration editor has been extended to allow complete files to be uploaded and downloaded. Furthermore, the backups of the files written in the background are optionally offered for download in the user interface

### Periodic tasks

There have been minor changes to the user interface in the Quartz job management section. When a task is paused, the schedule and date for the next execution are now not displayed. In addition, the icon for one-time execution has been changed.
