# October 2019

## New REST endpoint for file upload into an operation.

A file can now be copied to one of the image folders of an operation via multipart POST. The endpoint looks like this:

POST `https://mygoobi.tld/goobi/api/processes/{processId}/images/{folder}`

If `{folder}` is set to "master", it will be uploaded to the master folder, otherwise to the derivatives folder.
